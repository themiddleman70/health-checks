# health-checks
Scripts that check the health of a computer.

This repo will be populated with lots of fancy checks.

Currently the main script is health_checks.py.

This script will print "Everything okay" if all checks pass, or the corresponding error messages if some checks fail.

This was created while completing the Google IT Automation with Python certificate on Coursera.
